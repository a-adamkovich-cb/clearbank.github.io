## Managing Direct Debit Instructions

A Direct Debit Instruction (DDI) is an authorisation to collect future payments from a nominated account.
A DDI can be submitted to ClearBank by Service Users electronically via the Bacs Automated Direct Debit Instruction Service (AUDDIS) or sent as a paper instruction to your address to be entered via the ClearBank API after you have validated it.
A DDI can be set up against real and virtual accounts held with ClearBank. You will receive the Bacs Mandate Initiated webhook once the DDI is present in our system.

If you are transferring an existing sort code to ClearBank that already has DDIs set up, you will need to use the API to inform us of these.

To receive feedback during DDI management, subscribe to the relevant webhooks which are listed [here] (#bacs-ddi).

**Note**: Occasionally a customer might receive a Bacs Mandate Cancellation Failed webhook, after having cancelled a Direct Debit Instruction through the `DELETE` endpoints.  This does not necessarily mean a real failure. This situation can arise as in the following example:<br/>
A end customer cancels their phone contract with "FabuPhone". FabuPhone immediately cancel the DDI through the Bacs system. The end-customer also requests that you cancel the DDI, and you attempt to do so using the DELETE endpoint. As the instruction was already cancelled, it no longer exists and cannot be found. You will then receive a Cancellation Failed webhook.<br/> 
You can use the `GET endpoint (GET /{vn}/Accounts/{accountId}/Mandates)` to check the DDIs in place for the account and verify that everything is as it should be.

## Creating your authentication profile

Your ClearBank® authentication profile links your Institution to your public key therefore, it must be valid.

This is a breakdown of your authentication profile:

- A Key Pair (public/private)
- A Certificate Signing Request (CSR) in PKCS #10 format*
- A token


*In simulation, a CSR can be generated using Open Source solutions. In production, a CSR must be generated using a Hardware Security Module (HSM) which is FIPS 140-2 level 2 compliant. Solutions include, but are not limited to, Azure KV HSM, Amazon CloudHSM, GoogleCloudHSM

### Follow these steps to create a valid authentication profile

- Generate your Public Key and Private Key pair in PKCS #8 format*
- Generate your Certificate Signing Request (CSR) in PKCS #10 format which contains your certificate and Public Key
- Save your CSR as a .csr file.
- Sign in to the Institution portal.
- From the Menu, select **Institution > Certificates and Tokens**.

*In simulation, you can utilise Open Source tools to store your Private Key. In production, you must use a physical or virtual HSM solution to store your private key (see HSM requirements above)

## Responding to a webhook

The webhook sent by ClearBank速 acts as a verification mechanism.
You have verified that it is ClearBank速 who has sent you the webhook and now ClearBank速 needs to verify that you have successfully received the webhook (based on your response acknowledging receipt).
This verification occurs when you return a `200` HTTP response which includes the `Nonce` number in the `response body`  and your `DigitalSignature`.
If your response is invalid, we will consider it a failed webhook.
ClearBank速 will send the webhook every 15 minutes for 24 hours unless a successful response is returned by you.

To create the webhook digital signature:
- Take the Nonce number from the webhook and place it in the body of the response (e.g. `"{"nonce": <value>}"`.
- Hash the response body using `SHA 256`.
- Sign the hash with your `Private Key` and attach the signed hash as `Base64` encoded in the `DigitalSignature` Response Header.

> Your Private Key needs to correspond to a Public Key which has been used to create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR). Refer to [creating your authentication profile](/#creating-your-authentication-profile) for more information.

Example webhook request body:
```
{
	"Type": "FITestEvent",
	"Version": 1,
	"Payload": {
      "Hello": "World"
    },
	"Nonce": 1448545215
}
```

Example 200 Response

	"Nonce": 1448545215
}
```

You may occasionally receive multiple webhooks with the same `EndtoEndTransactionId`. In this instance, a duplicate check should take place using the `TransactionId`.
If the same `TransactionId` is used for both payments, the webhook will be a duplicate. In case the TransactionId(s) are different, these will relate to separate transactions.

A full list of webhook documentation is available on ClearBank®'s Knowledge Centre and access can be granted as part of your onboarding journey. Please reach out to your main contact ClearBank® for more information.

## HTTP Status Codes

ClearBank® requests return a HTTP status code to indicate the success or failure of a request. For successful requests, ClearBank® returns a HTTP `2XX` status code. For failed requests, ClearBank® returns a HTTP `4XX` or `5XX` status code. Some endpoints return JSON response bodies that include errors and additional properties.
